              The demigods are each and all the direct offspring of Queen Marika.<br />

              The Rune of Death goes by two names; the other is Destined Death.<br />
              The forbidden shadow, plucked from the Golden Order upon its creation…<br />
              Unleashing the rune now would be unthinkable...<br />

              For the flame to burn the Erdtree, a sacrifice is needed. Of one who envisions the flame.<br />

              I stole a fragment of the Rune of Death, and used it to forge the godslaying black knives through fearsome rite.<br />
              I did it all.<br />
              But sadly for thee, the cursemark thou seekest is not to be found here.<br />
              I have slain the body I was born into, and cast it away.<br />

              I performed the act not to bury the past, nor in shame of the deed,<br />
              but all the same, thy begging compels me not a jot.<br />

              I am the witch Ranni. I stole Death long ago, and search now for the dark path.<br />
              That I might one day upend the whole of it, and rid the world of all that came before.<br />

              I wish you luck, in realising your ambition.<br />
              You have fought long and hard.<br />
              I have no doubt you will become Elden Lord. May you take the throne. </p>

          <p class="lore">Hello again, old friend.<br />
              It's me, Melina. Your travelling companion.<br />
              Allow me a moment to converse with you.<br />
              You were unable to enter the Erdtree, no?<br />
              Prevented by the mantle of barbs.<br />
              The thorns are impenetrable.<br />
              A husk of the Erdtree's being; that spurns all that exists without.<br />
              The only way to stand before the Elden Ring...<br />
              and become the Elden Lord...is to pass the thorns.<br />
              My purpose serves to aid in that very act.<br />
              So I'd like you to undertake a new journey, with me.<br />
              To the flame of ruin, far above the clouds, upon the snowy mountaintops of the giants.<br />
              Then I can set the Erdtree aflame.<br />
              And guide you. Down the path to becoming Elden Lord. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">I wish to journey with you once more.<br />

              All I ask of you is to make the journey.<br />
              To the snowy mountaintops of the giants, far above the clouds.<br />
              I know...<br />
              I'm asking you to commit a cardinal sin.<br />
              But it must be done to reach the path beyond.<br />
              And that is the path I wish to travel.<br />
              What is your mind? </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">There is something I'd like to say.<br />
              My purpose was given to me by my mother.<br />

              I have set my heart upon the world that I would have.<br />
              Regardless of my mother's designs.<br />
              I won't allow anyone to speak ill of that.<br />

              I must tender my thanks to Torrent, too.<br />
              Thank you, Torrent.<br />

              But once he's out of the way, it will spring back into motion.<br />
              So now, we stand against the demigod once known as the strongest of them all.<br />
              The way ahead is pleasingly simple. We fight, sword and fang. </p>

              A falling star, right before our eyes!<br />
              I can't fathom how Radahn was holding back something of that scale.<br />

              And, the path has now been cleared.<br />
              To Nokron, where Ranni's fate will be decided.<br />

              This territory once belonged to the Carian royal family. Their manor lies not far beyond this point.<br />
              When the Raya Lucaria Academy turned on the Carians, the Knights of the Cuckoo descended on this tract.<br />
              After leveling it, they carried on to the manor.<br />
              The Carians were taken off guard, but their strength had not waned, and they repelled the knights' onslaught...<br />

              That is why I say, Tarnished. Don't go near the manor.<br />
              Unless you wish to lie with the corpses of the heedless Knights of the Cuckoo. </p>

          <p class="lore">Oh, watch out, there.<br />
              When I'm absorbed in my smithing, I lose sight of all else.<br />
              If you come too close, I'm apt to cause you harm.<br />
              I am, after all, terribly large compared to you, Tarnished.<br />

              Of the enchanted snare that remains at the royal Carian Manor.<br />
              Whatever you do, brave Tarnished, stay away from that deathtrap. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Blaidd actually did that, did he?<br />
              Quite a rare occurrence, for such a guarded soul as he.<br />
              Perhaps he sensed something unusual about you.<br />
              At any rate, if you're friendly with Blaidd,<br />
              I've a few more things that might suit you.<br />
              I've something else that might suit you. </p>

          <p class="lore">Oh, so you were the one. Lady Ranni has explained everything.<br />
              Again, I am Iji.<br />
              The Carian royal family's dedicated blacksmith, and Lady Ranni's war counsellor.<br />
              I am told that you are searching for Nokron with Blaidd.<br />

          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">I take it you've heard of the Eternal City of Nokstella?<br />
              Well, it has a twin, known as Nokron. The other Eternal City.<br />
              After years of expeditions, we've determined the location of Nokron.<br />
              By going underground through the well in the Mistwood of Limgrave, you can see Nokron up above.<br />
              Only, we've failed to find a path leading to the city.<br />
              Blaidd's made a good go of it, but I'm afraid this has him quite stumped.<br />
              To be honest, I'm not sure where to go from here... </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Blaidd is Lady Ranni's stepbrother.<br />
              Ranni's mother, Queen Rennala, approved of him, and they played like siblings from childhood.<br />
              They were always happy to have me tag along, as well.<br />
              When Lady Ranni renounced her flesh, and chose the dark path of the Empyrean,<br />
              Blaidd and I swore allegiance as vassals,<br />
              but none of us will ever forget our earliest days together.<br />
              Promise to look after Blaidd for me, will you?<br />
              The man is honest to a fault. But fortunately, now he has you. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Jerren. Now, that's a name I haven't heard for a while.<br />
              Before taking up the banner of General Radahn, he was a guest of the Carian royal family.<br />
              An expert swordsman, to be sure, but ever the eccentric.<br />
              No surprise he'd get wrapped up in some festival.<br />
              Oh, no, wait...<br />
              How did I not see it before!<br />
              I ought to retire as war counsellor for such a gross oversight!<br />
              Let me explain. The fate of the Carian royal family is guided by the stars.<br />
              As is the fate of Lady Ranni, first heir in the Carian royal line.<br />
              But General Radahn is the conqueror of the stars.<br />
              Who stood up to the swirling constellations, halting their movement in a smashing victory.<br />
              And so, if General Radahn were defeated, the stars would once again resume their movement.<br />
              As would Lady Ranni's destiny.<br />
              Perhaps, even, revealing the elusive path. That leads to Nokron. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">My apologies for the misleading words of warning.<br />
              I never imagined that an audience, let alone service to Lady Ranni was in your fate.<br />
              I, for one, should have seen it, but I did not.<br />
              Do forgive me, my fellow.<br />
              Let us give all that we can of ourselves.<br />
              Together, for Lady Ranni. </p>

          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Go with Blaidd to the festival grounds.<br />
              Should General Radahn be defeated, the stars would once again resume their movement.<br />
              Perhaps revealing the elusive path to Nokron. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Ah, you've finally come. Blaidd told me everything.<br />
              You've defeated General Radahn, unlocking the stars.<br />
              The General was blighted by scarlet rot and driven to madness, but not long ago he was hailed as the mightiest demigod of them all.<br />
              There is no parallel to your achievement. Nor to Lady Ranni's acute judgement of character.<br />
              Thanks to you, Lady Ranni's fate once again stirs, and the path to Nokron has opened.<br />
              Descend underground where the fallen star struck Limgrave.<br />
              And make it yours. The precious treasure of Nokron. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Oh, Blaidd wanted me to tell you.<br />
              Not to bother waiting for him, and head straight to Nokron.<br />
              Blaidd has been given an important task.<br />
              Apparently, a matter of great urgency. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">You need not await Blaidd.<br />
              Descend underground alone where the fallen star struck Limgrave.<br />
              And make it yours. The precious treasure of Nokron.<br />
              So that Lady Ranni may tread the dark path of the Empyrean. </p>

              Jerren's duties are finally fulfilled.<br />
              Though we served different masters, I could see he was truly adept in his role.<br />
              Now the time has come to remind him of an old promise made.<br />
              With the stars of fate set into motion, a certain sorceress is dispossessed of her immortality...<br />
              Finally, we can be rid of a longstanding Carian weed... </p>

              It's funny how things happen.<br />
              Jerren and I parted ways long, long ago, yet here he is, playing his part in Lady Ranni's fate.<br />
              I'm afraid I never saw it coming. And I thought myself a capable war counsellor... </p>

              Very well. There is something you should know.<br />
              The Two Fingers gave Blaidd to Lady Ranni, as a faithful follower. Her very shadow, incapable of treachery.<br />
              But if Lady Ranni, as an Empyrean, resists being an instrument of the Two Fingers,<br />
              the shadow will go mad, transforming from a follower into a horrid curse.<br />
              But such is his destiny. In such matters, Blaidd's own thoughts hold no weight.<br />
              It pains me so, but he must be neutralised. For Lady Ranni's sake. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Unthinkable, how could Blaidd...<br />
              How did he break free from his cell?<br />
              No, more importantly...<br />
              Blaidd became a curse that plagued Lady Ranni, yet even in madness, gave himself to her.<br />
              I've made a grave misjudgment. And I thought myself a capable war counsellor...<br />
              I'll catch up with you soon enough, Blaidd.<br />

              Of the true ruler of this manor, Lord Rykard.<br />
              The Erdtree blessed the Tarnished with grace.<br />

              The Tarnished were forced to scavenge, squabbling for crumbs.<br />
              Like the shardbearers, vying for power in the wake of the Shattering.<br />
              Our Lord, indignant, has refused. To scurry about, fighting over what miserly scraps they allow us.<br />
              If the Erdtree, and indeed the very gods, would debase us so,<br />
              then we are willing to raise the banner of resistance, even if it means heresy.<br />
              We at the Volcano Manor, under Lord Rykard, have sworn no rest until it is done.<br />
              If you follow this heroic path, one day the Lord will see you.<br />
              The Lord's visits with our champions are always a spectacle.<br />
              It cannot come a day too soon! </p>

              Yes, yes, I've heard all about you.<br />
              I am Seluvis, preceptor in the sorcerous arts.<br />
              I don't know what it is the mistress sees in a provincial Tarnished like you,<br />
              but since we have the misfortune of serving the same Lady,<br />
              I ask that you kindly try not to drag us all down with you. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">I reside...in another tower, close by.<br />
              Come and pay me a visit...<br />
              Should you wish to be of actual service to Mistress Ranni.<br />
              If it were up to me, I wouldn't waste my time on the likes of you.<br />

              Hmm, I suppose you're here now.<br />
              Perhaps I'll give you something to do.<br />
              I'd like you to find a woman called Nepheli, to administer a potion.<br />

              Now I shall hand over the potion in question.<br />
              Find Nepheli, and ensure she drinks it.<br />
              I expect glad tidings. And soon. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">I see...<br />
              What a wretched bunch you Tarnished are.<br />
              Do you understand? I've given you a very fine chance.<br />
              If you complete this simple task, I will graciously permit you to learn from me.<br />
              Even you wish to serve our Lady well, do you not?<br />

          <p class="lore">Have you fumbled out the correct answer now?<br />

          <p class="lore">I could have sworn I told you to trouble me no more...<br />

          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Good, good.<br />
              As a man of abundant charity, I accept your apology.<br />

              Are we understood? Then off you trot.<br />
              I have enough on my plate. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Ahh, so you made Nepheli drink the potion?<br />
              Well done. You are a touch more useful than I had thought.<br />
              Well done. You are a slight more useful than I had thought.<br />
              Very well. Then you shall have your gift.<br />
              Knowledge of the sorcerous arts, under the tutelage of the great Preceptor Seluvis.<br />
              I doubt much of it will lay within the grasp of a mere Tarnished, but...<br />
              If you put your mind to it, perhaps you won't embarrass our Lady. </p>

              There remains much to be done. Make it quick. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Come now, the pretence of comprehension becomes you not.<br />
              Bend over backwards any further and you're apt to break. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Well, well. You're asking me about that, are you?<br />
              The task was left to you and the mongrel, was it not?<br />
              Not only are you incompetent, but shameless to boot.<br />
              Well...there's no helping it.<br />
              Now's as good a time as any. I'll let you in on it.<br />
              There's a glintstone sorcerer by the name of Sellen in Limgrave.<br />
              She owes me for the help I gave her when she was expelled from the academy.<br />
              I asked her to look into the matter some time ago.<br />
              I'll write you a letter of introduction. Go ask her. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">So, you had Nepheli drink the potion? Truly?<br />
              Hmm. Then perhaps something was amiss with it.<br />
              It's concocted from the finest ingredients. But perhaps I should review the recipe.<br />
              I may have expected too much of her, to begin with. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">You break into a man's private chambers, rooting about as you please?<br />
              Your oafishness knows no bounds.<br />
              Fine and well.<br />
              You tricked Nepheli, and had her drink the potion.<br />
              I believe that makes you my accomplice.<br />
              You yearn for a puppet of your own, hmm?<br />
              Well, normally one of your stature would never be allowed.<br />
              But perhaps I can make a very special exception.<br />
              Now, choose. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Ah, I knew you'd see things my way.<br />
              You knew you were already my accomplice, and as such...<br />
              You wanted one for yourself, hmm? A puppet, to cherish.<br />
              Oh I can see right through you. That's just the kind of man you are.<br />
              Oh I can see right through you. That's just the kind of woman you are.<br />
              Well, it's been some time since a pupil of mine last walked this road.<br />
              To mark the occasion, I shall grant you the puppet you so desire.<br />
              Now, choose. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Well, this is a surprise.<br />
              But aren't we forgetting something?<br />
              The tipple you fooled Nepheli into drinking, yes, my little draught.<br />
              You are already my accomplice.<br />
              Are you ready to change your mind, now?<br />
              It's no sin, pining for a puppet to cherish. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Now, hand it over, and don't make a fuss.<br />
              Nothing bad will happen. I'll even consider giving you a puppet of your own. </p>

          <p class="lore">(huge sigh)<br />

          <p class="lore">I thought I told you never to show your face again.<br />
              Have you decided to return what's mine, and proffer a sincere apology? </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Good, good.<br />
              As a man of abundant charity, I accept your apology.<br />
              And well, you finally realised, did you?<br />
              All you really wanted was a puppet to cherish. To fill that hole deep in your heart.<br />
              Oh I can see right through you. That's just the kind of man you are.<br />

          <p class="lore">How's the puppet I gave you?<br />
              A thing of exquisite craft, is it not? </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">What's that? You want another puppet?<br />
              Quite the keen paramour, aren't we.<br />
              Well, aren't you a woman of many passions.<br />
              But, I'm afraid each and every one is like a child to me.<br />
              I can hardly just give them away.<br />
              Oh dear, what's to be done?<br />
              Why don't you...fetch me some starlight shards?<br />
              It's no mere booze, but a refined old drink of amber hue.<br />
              If you can manage it, I'll gladly prepare a new puppet for you.<br />
              The soul of every puppet has its own ambience. You'll soon come to know, once you possess a few.<br />
              And once each's predilections are known to you, the better you'll be able to love them.<br />
              Oh yes, you have much to look forward to, further down this road. </p>

              A ploy to fool even Lady Ranni... How does that sound? </p>

              Heh. I knew I had you pegged.<br />
              You're just like me.<br />
              Then I'd like you to procure something.<br />
              A rather unique starlight shard that glistens with amber.<br />
              With that, my special draught will gleam with nectar-sweetness.<br />

              To think, this was once a demigod's very fate...<br />

              Now, just you wait. The merriment is soon to begin.<br />
              The scheme I promised is to be revealed very shortly... </p>

          <p class="lore">Good, I've been waiting for you.<br />
              It's finally complete. The perfection of my draught, gleaming nectar-sweet.<br />
              Give it to Ranni and ensure she drinks it.<br />
              The dead-eyed doll lets down her guard in your presence, rather remarkably.<br />
              Though she might dip her hands in the dirt, and feign that icy persona…she's a frail, gentle girl at heart.<br />
              Though she might dip her hands in the dirt, and feign that icy persona...she's still just a feeble, pampered little girl when it comes down to it.<br />
              Which is why you're the only one for the job.<br />
              Now do it. Make Ranni drink my draught. </p>

              So, I'm perfectly happy to take it off your hands.<br />
              That said, don't you dare get your hopes up.<br />
              More often than not, new knowledge is merely an opportunity to reflect…<br />

              then tell him to pack up and ship out.<br />
              I never liked the din of a dog's howl.<br />
              From a mongrel like him, it's simply agony. </p>

              Scheming has its place, but consider the one you're scheming against.<br />

              They're all foot soldiers. Survivors of a defeated army.<br />
              Worked to the bone by their high-and-mighty lord, only to be thrown out with the rubbish.<br />

              Well I heard something that might help. A special means of reaching your destination.<br />
              Have you ever seen an iron virgin?<br />
              The clunky contraptions are whirlwinds of sickles and spiked wheels.<br />
              ...but long ago, they were endowed with a spell of transposition.<br />
              And get this. A surviving virgin sits at the bottom of the big waterwheel in the Academy of Raya Lucaria.<br />
              Its transpositional powers fully intact.<br />
              So, right, if you get caught in it on purpose...<br />
              It'll chuck you out straight at the base of the Erdtree... Or so I'm told...<br />
              Ha ha...ha ha... </p>

          <p class="lore">Oh yeah, great story isn't it. I'll tell you as many times as you like.<br />
              There's a surviving Iron Virgin at the bottom of the big waterwheel in the Academy of Raya Lucaria.<br />
              And I heard...if you let yourself get caught in it, it'll chuck you out straight at the base of the Erdtree.<br />

              You were trapped inside a volcano, no mistake,<br />
              but the Erdtree was right outside. You just had to spring yourself out.<br />
              I'm willing to admit. I could have been more clear.<br />
              But I did not lie, and you're perfectly unscathed. All's well that ends well, right? </p>

              Not to mention Tanith has always made me curious.<br />
              I guess her master must really be something, cause she's pretty damn smug about it.<br />

              The demigod beast is slain, and Tanith has lost her head.<br />
              A fine mess, but how else could it end when daddy ambition is head over heels courting lady blasphemy.<br />
              Heh heh...ha ha...<br />

              Did I forget to announce myself?<br />
              I am Rya, in the service of Lady Tanith of the Volcano Manor.<br />
              I seek stalwart Tarnished who might join our house.<br />
              You are very brave yourself. Not only a steady hand,<br />
              but a steady heart, merciless, even to your own kind.<br />
              Such strength is precisely what my mistress seeks.<br />
              Please, take this.<br />
              Brave Tarnished, seek the Altus Plateau, the realm of the Erdtree.<br />
              Most Tarnished are doomed to wander the outskirts of the Lands Between, peering wistfully at the towering Erdtree...<br />
              But you are no ordinary Tarnished. And once that is proven,<br />
              the Volcano Manor will fully extend its invitation. To fight, amongst a family of champions. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Ohh, and... One more thing, only for you...<br />
              This land of Liurnia is connected to the Altus Plateau by the Grand Lift of Dectus, beyond the High Road.<br />
              But the lift has been defunct for an age, meaning there's no simple means of passage.<br />
              Instead, you must seek the old ruins in the cliff.<br />
              At the base of the valley near the Grand Lift, there's an old tunnel.<br />
              It was excavated from both ends, linking Liurnia to the Altus Plateau.<br />
              I have faith in you. A champion, through and through.<br />
              I do hope that we can meet again. </p>

              Revenge is not the answer.<br />
              According to Lady Tanith...<br />
              I've got the stuff of champions.<br />
              And champions, ironic as it is, are oft forced to walk a tainted path.<br />
              It hit me like a bolt from the blue...<br />
              That my former thoughts were simple naiveté.<br />
              Of course, my heart weeps for Lanya.<br />
              That unfortunate incident was a cruel twist of fate indeed.<br />
              But succumbing to the pain and sadness caused won't
              make me a champion, will it.<br />
              Lanya knows this, I'm certain. Fate has laid hard roads for us both.<br />
              But such is true of any road trod by champions. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">I always resented these hands.<br />
              Their pale complexion, a far cry from any warrior's. The shame of House Hoslow.<br />
              But that won't be the case for long.<br />
              They'll be darkened by grit, once I've set out on the path of champions.<br />

              No. It's worse than that. As things stand I've given up on the

              You make me proud. To have grown little legs so readily.<br />

              The stars alter the fate of the Carian royal family. And the fate of your mistress, Ranni.<br />
              But long ago, General Radahn challenged the swirling constellations, and in a crushing victory, arrested their cycles.<br />
              Now, he is the force that repulses the stars.<br />
              If General Radahn were to die, the stars would resume their movement.<br />
              And so, too, would Ranni's destiny. </p>

              A little while ago someone started lurking in the wing on the opposite side of the roundtable.<br />
              And I can hear, from all the way over there...<br />
              The howling and wailing of spirits in fear of a curse. I can even hear the repulsive, twisted malison itself...<br />
              A plethora of spirits in an unceasing cacophony...<br />
              I can't even imagine. How much suffering, inflicted to who knows how many souls...<br />
              Not even the grafting caused anything like this to happen...<br />
              You should keep your distance.<br />
              I know you're strong, but please... </p>

          <p class="lore">I can hear it from across the wing, past the roundtable...<br />

              I can hear them; the spirits as they howl and lament in fear of the curse.<br />
              And worse than ever, the reverberations of the twisted malison itself.<br />
              But after all this time, I've started to grasp it now.<br />
              I can hear, in the malison, another fearsome Order. </p>

              Did you...have anything to do with it, I wonder? </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Take a look around. The Roundtable Hold is burned. Razed to the ground.<br />
              The Two Fingers went mad, and the Tarnished have all left.<br />
              Myself and Master Hewg are the only ones who remain.<br />
              Don't worry, I don't blame you.<br />

              A fearsome curse, put on him by Queen Marika.<br />
              And if that's the case, I'm not sure there's anything we can do... </p>

              I knew he'd burn himself out, old Hewg.<br />
              I think we could talk him into leaving the Roundtable Hold, now.<br />
              But maybe it's better that we don't.<br />
              It's only proper that we respect his choice to stay. </p>

          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Ah, you've come to lend me your aid, have you?<br />
              Well, that's very kind, but, um...<br />
              No, no. Th-the help is very much appreciated. Even from a Tarnished.<br />
              Despite appearances, nobility is no prerequisite to serving the true Order.<br />
              You might have heard of me. Kenneth Haight. Next in line as the rightful ruler of Limgrave.<br />
              Young Tarnished, I would have a boon of you.<br />
              I want you to take back my fort. It lies to the south, beyond the Mistwood.<br />
              A Knight commander from Stormveil took it. A fool, and plumb mad to boot. Simply obsessed with blood! </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Hm? What's this, kind sir?<br />
              Hm? What's this, fair lady?<br />
              Remarkable! The Knight Commander, dead. Already!<br />
              A blessing, if ever I chanced upon one.<br />
              Fine work, I say, fine work, indeed.<br />
              I doubt that it was your intention, but the deed is done, and I commend you.<br />
              Now, this is your reward.<br />
              Go on, it is yours, for the keeping. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Ah-ha! I've been waiting for you with baited breath!<br />
              Did you manage to recapture my fort?<br />
              Oh excellent news, just wonderful. And the knight's dead to boot!<br />
              Well done my friend, well done indeed!<br />
              I knew I was right to trust you!<br />
              Now, here's your reward, as promised.<br />
              Go ahead, it's all yours. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Right then. Time for me to head to the fort.<br />
              I've much to do. First I'll have to reestablish communication with the demi-humans.<br />
              What's that look? You don't believe me?<br />
              Well, under the Erdtree, commingling with the demi-humans is made possible.<br />
              Even the vulgar shall not be left behind, under the rule of true Order.<br />
              Which is why I, Kenneth Haight, next in line as the rightful ruler of Limgrave, have sworn to uphold it.<br />
              Just you watch, my friend. Just you watch. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Ah, yes. I've been meaning to ask.<br />
              Would you like to enter my service?<br />
              I see bright things in your future, stout warrior.<br />
              Enter into my service and learn the workings of the Erdtree's true Order.<br />
              And who knows, perhaps some time down the line, the grace of gold will return to those Tarnished eyes of yours.<br />
              What say you? A fine accord, is it not? </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Very well. Very well, indeed.<br />
              I knew I saw something in you.<br />
              I shall await you at my fort.<br />
              We shall hold the ceremony for your knighting there, I think.<br />
              I see great things ahead of us. We are truly by the Erdtree blessed. </p>

              Oh, indeed, it is a foul fate for a land, to be without a ruler.<br />
              One must be found, with haste. And not that awful Godrick.<br />

          <p class="lore">I am sorry to have lifted your hopes...<br />
              But I haven't the authority to raise you to knighthood as things stand.<br />
              The great Kenneth Haight issues his sincerest apology.<br />
              But now, I must begin my search post-haste.<br />
              For a true and stalwart Lord of the proper lineage to take the reigns of Limgrave. </p>

              For the time being, I share command of the castle with my Lady, but I plan on returning to my fort afterwards.<br />

              Doing so will grant me the warmth of a champion.<br />

          <p class="lore">I was known as a Deathbed Companion, where I come from.<br />

              I lay with the remains of an exalted noble, to grant him another chance at life.<br />
              To do so is the purpose of my being.<br />
              But before I could bear the noble into new life,<br />
              I was awakened by the guidance of grace, and chased from my birthplace.<br />
              Pray, be kind.<br />
              Despite all that, I still wish to be a Deathbed Companion.<br />

              A certain person gave it to me, as a gift.<br />
              It's a very precious thing. It must have a special place in the owner's heart.<br />

              Stand before the Elden Ring, and become the Elden Lord.<br />
              If those words held any meaning to you...<br />
              Follow the guidance of grace, lay low the shardbearers, and claim for yourself a Great Rune.<br />
              Do so, and the doors to the Roundtable's inner chamber will open.<br />

              I am accumulating knowledge. To be all-knowing.<br />
              You now belong to a select group of fellows. As such, I ask that you remain constant. </p>

          <p class="lore">You'll be after more Great Runes, now eh?<br />
              Then as your fellow, allow me to divulge a little knowledge.<br />
              The inheritors of the Great Runes; the shardbearers.<br />
              We of the Roundtable know the location of five of them, including the one you defeated.<br />
              Godrick the Grafted, Lord of Stormveil.<br />
              General Radahn, who fought Malenia and her rot to a standstill in the Caelid Wilds.<br />
              Praetor Rykard, Lord of the Volcano Manor of Mt. Gelmir.<br />
              Morgott the Grace-Given, Veiled Monarch and Lord of Leyndell.<br />
              And Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon, ruler of Raya Lucaria's Academy.<br />
              ...You'll still be after more Great Runes, won't you? </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">So. Godrick the Grafted, Lord of Stormveil.<br />
              Despite being the blood of Godfrey, first Elden Lord, he's a grotesque old fool, grasping for power.<br />
              His castle lies upon the cliff to Limgrave's northwest.<br />
              ...but I suspect you know that well enough already. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">General Radahn, the famed Red Lion and scourge of the stars, is a ferocious warrior.<br />
              He fought Malenia and her rot to a standstill in the Caelid Wilds to Limgrave's east.<br />
              And now Caelid has been engulfed by the scarlet rot, even approaching the region is no mean feat.<br />
              I've heard survivors of Radahn's army are still in the wilds, staving off the rot with fire.<br />
              And if it's true, I suspect Radahn is still there as well, in Caelid.<br />
              Though I doubt he much resembles his former self anymore... </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Praetor Rykard is the Lord of the Volcano Manor on Mt. Gelmir.<br />
              He is a ruthless justiciar who commands a company of inquisitors, reviled for his serpentine demeanour.<br />
              The volcano, Mt. Gelmir, lies in the west of the Altus Plateau; the realm of the Erdtree.<br />
              It was the stage of the most appalling battle in the entirety of the Shattering.<br />
              Rykard has committed the grave sin of blasphemy. Marking himself as an enemy, never to be forgiven. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Morgott the Grace-Given is Lord of Leyndell, the capital city.<br />
              It lies at the foot of the Erdtree, in the east of the Altus Plateau.<br />
              But the Two Fingers forbid us from venturing there.<br />
              Until we've acquired enough Great Runes to repair the Elden Ring.<br />
              Set your sights elsewhere for the time being. The Veiled Monarch can wait. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">The Academy of Raya Lucaria lies to Limgrave's north, towering over the mist-laden lands of Liurnia.<br />
              Rennala is the queen of the Carian royals, who govern the academy.<br />
              But Rennala herself is no demigod.<br />
              She is merely the recipient of an amber egg, given to her by Radagon,<br />
              Her beloved, Radagon, left her to become Queen Marika's second husband, taking the title of King Consort.<br />
              The Great Rune dwells within the amber egg that was Radagon's gift to her. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">There are four more demigods yet to be located.<br />
              Miquella of the Haligtree, the Unalloyed.<br />
              His twin, Malenia, the undefeated swordswoman.<br />
              Lunar Princess Ranni, daughter to Rennala.<br />
              And the one only known as the Lord of Blood.<br />
              Ranni is said to have cast aside her Great Rune,<br />
              so here at the Hold, we seek the whereabouts of the remaining three shardbearers.<br />
              If you should learn anything of these matters,<br />
              I'll trade your findings for a hidden treasure, or a long-lost rite, known only to me.<br />
              We both desire to stand before the Elden Ring, and become Elden Lord.<br />
              As such, I hope we are compelled to work together.<br />
              I'll trade your findings for something rather special. </p>

          <p class="lore">Well. I see you've found another Great Rune.<br />
              Wonderful. You are a worthy fellow Tarnished, indeed.<br />
              Make the journey.<br />
              To the capital Leyndell, that lies to the east of the Altus Plateau, at the foot of the Erdtree.<br />
              The Two Fingers will deny your passage no longer.<br />
              You may be our best hope. Find your way to the Elden Ring.<br />
              For we are Tarnished. And we must answer the call of grace. </p>

              Though a mere axe-wielding barbarian, her youthful credulity suited my purposes.<br />
              So I put her to work.<br />
              Do not hesitate to employ her, should her services benefit you.<br />
              Despite her looks, she is more than capable in the press of battle. </p>

          <p class="lore">Ahh, you've already heard?<br />
              Indeed, it seemed the whelp harboured suspicions.<br />
              So I had no further use for her.<br />
              Honestly, what's a man to do.<br />
              A determined plebian is more wicked than an Omen horn, quite frankly.<br />
              I suspect...that's just what the Queen wants.<br />
              A dose of ambition, to incite the Tarnished. </p>

              The Roundtable has no code to speak of.<br />
              But, I ask you this. Are you really going to do the bidding of that twisted dolly botherer?<br />
              Or would you rather hand that potion to me, and see if we can't get one over on the bastard? </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Good. I'll dispose of the potion myself.<br />
              You go and see Seluvis, but don't give anything away.<br />
              Just tell him that you tricked your mark into drinking the potion as planned.<br />
              Despite knowing next to bloody nothing, he's so far up his own arse he won't suspect a thing.<br />
              His inevitable display of arrogance will certainly be a sight to behold. </p>

          <p class="lore">Well, I won't force you.<br />
              But I think your plan would be a dreadful waste.<br />
              She's not herself right now, and though I have no need of her, she still has potential.<br />
              Certainly more value than she'd have as a bloody puppet. </p>

              It doesn't have to be me, my fellow. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">If you're heading to the forge of the flame of ruin, in the snowy mountaintops of the giants.<br />
              You'll need to find the Grand Lift of Rold, beyond the forbidden region.<br />
              I marked your map with its location.<br />
              Go, if you would. Take no heed of "cardinal sin".<br />
              The Two Fingers lost their purpose a long, long time ago. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Ahh, I see you've laid your hands on the other secret medallion.<br />
              I'm glad to see my counsel has borne fruit, but the honour of the deed is yours alone.<br />
              You've made more of yourself than Ensha has...<br />
              Now, more importantly, both secret medallions are in your hands.<br />
              I suppose you'd like to know then? What awaits you on the path ahead?<br />
              Me too, my friend, me too. I wait with baited breath. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Ahh, so the secret medallions led you to the land of the Haligtree?<br />
              I'd expect to find Malenia there. She who fought Radahn to a standstill.<br />
              Well, if the scarlet rot hasn't eaten her away completely.<br />
              But...with the Haligtree as it is...<br />
              I suppose Miquella must already be... </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Ah, my apologies. Lost myself, for a moment there.<br />
              The information you've shared is of great value. As promised, your reward:<br />
              A hidden treasure, known only to me.<br />
              A secret rite known only to me.<br />
              You are a true fellow. All I ask is that you remain constant.<br />
              And it is a wondrous thing indeed. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">So. The Haligtree, now but a husk...<br />
              I heard speculation Miquella embedded himself in the Haligtree,<br />
              but before he could finish, someone cut the tree open and absconded with his infant form.<br />
              Indeed, it seems those words held weight.<br />
              How vexing. That the All-knowing didn't have the full story...<br />
              Perhaps the Queen's sorrow was justified... </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Oh, so that's where the so-called Lord of Blood was hiding himself eh.<br />
              A fitting little squat for that deluded maniac to bleat about the revival of his precious dynasty, while he turns our fellow Tarnished into Bloody Fingers.<br />
              Let him stay there. That way, his delusions will remain as they are - distant and unattainable.<br />
              But perhaps it's worth looking into...<br />
              If what I've heard is right, then maybe... </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Ahh, I see! So Miquella was with the Lord of Blood after all!<br />
              That is some fine intelligence indeed!<br />
              With it, the final clue has been brought into the light.<br />
              One of the last few pieces the Roundtable-- I need, to put everything together.<br />
              As promised, allow me to impart to you<br />
              the last of the hidden treasures known only to me.<br />
              the last of the secret rites known only to me.<br />
              a thing most wondrous, known only to me. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Well, I wonder what comes next...<br />
              If he continues his slumber within the cocoon, all would be well.<br />
              But perhaps it would be safer to destroy it.<br />
              Miquella is the one thing that remains a mystery to me... </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">You...burned the Erdtree, didn't you?<br />
              Then the Roundtable is soon to follow.<br />
              Ah, no need to fret about that.<br />
              The Roundtable Hold served to put a Tarnished upon the throne of Elden Lord.<br />
              And if the Erdtree needed to burn for that to happen,<br />
              then the Roundtable must go, as well. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">I'll stay at the Roundtable, for a time.<br />
              I must learn all that can be taken from this place,<br />
              and sear it into my memory.<br />
              How could I call myself the All-Knowing, if I did any less? </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">The pursuit of knowledge is without end, for knowledge is never a thing complete.<br />
              Thus, I maintain the mantle of All-Knowing.<br />
              Perhaps the same could be said of guidance.<br />
              Who's to say whether we'll remain who we are, once the fight is finished?<br />
              What do you think, as one who aspires to become Elden Lord? </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Ahh, I knew you'd come.<br />
              To stand before the Elden Ring. To become Elden Lord.<br />
              What a sad state of affairs.<br />
              I commend your spirit, but alas, none shall take the throne.<br />
              Queen Marika has high hopes for us.<br />
              That we continue to struggle. Unto eternity. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">You think I don't know what that is?<br />
              I have no secrets for you to salaciously gawp at.<br />
              You think too little of Gideon Ofnir, the All-knowing. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">My fellow, you've fought well, until now. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">I know...in my bones...<br />
              A Tarnished cannot become a Lord. Not even you.<br />
              A man cannot kill a god... </p>

          <p class="lore">Ah, nice to meet you.<br />
              The pleasure's mine. Rogier's the name. A sorcerer, as you might have guessed.<br />
              I'm looking for a little something, here in the castle.<br />
              When I'm not hotfooting it from the troops, that is.<br />
              But enough about me, what are you doing here in Stormveil Castle?<br />
              This place is bristling with Tarnished hunters, you know. They sacrifice our kind, for grafting.<br />
              Not exactly a place I'd stroll into without a purpose in mind... </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">I see. Here to challenge Godrick, and lay your hands upon a Great Rune, are you?<br />
              You can see it then, I take it? The guidance of grace.<br />
              Well, enjoy it while you can.<br />
              I'm Tarnished, like you.<br />
              But unlike you, I've seen neither hide nor hair of this guidance for the longest time.<br />
              Still, I won't forget how it felt when I first came here, to the Lands Between.<br />
              I'm privy to a few magical battle arts.<br />
              Would you care to learn one?<br />
              As a fellow Tarnished, once guided by grace. I'd love to help you out, if it please. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Oh? Keen to learn another battle art, are we? </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Oh hello there, good to see you safe.<br />
              Stopping by to learn a battle art or two? </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">The battle art you've learned is of the glintstone family.<br />
              They were conceived at the great Academy of Raya Lucaria, to the north of this castle.<br />
              In the past, they obeyed laws which contravened the Golden Order, or so I'm told.<br />
              Fascinating, isn't it?<br />
              That the Golden Order was pliable enough to absorb practices that contradicted itself in the past.<br />
              With the Order broken, twisted, and in need of repair,<br />
              such adaptability is more important now than ever. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Of course. I understand.<br />
              Why place trust in a perfect stranger?<br />
              Be safe, then, stranger.<br />
              Watch you don't get sacrificed, eh. I'll do the same. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Oh? Something bothering you?<br />
              Or are you just trying to pass the time?<br />
              I'm curious how you ended up inside this castle. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Ah, we meet again after all.<br />
              I apologise for any offence given by my bearing, but I'm quite unable to move, you see.<br />
              So. What do you need? </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Ah, you defeated Godrick and claimed yourself a Great Rune.<br />
              Mm, looks like we both got we wanted out of Stormveil, didn't we.<br />
              Well done, friend.<br />
              Something to mark the occasion. Go on, take it.<br />
              As you might've guessed, I still can't move. My fighting days are behind me.<br />
              No need to be polite, I've no use for it anymore. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">The misshapen corpse under Stormveil?<br />
              That is a sacred relic. Of the black knives plot. As that famed night of assassination is known.<br />
              It happened during the Golden Age of the Erdtree, long before the shattering of the Elden Ring.<br />
              Someone stole a fragment of the Rune of Death from Maliketh, the Black Blade.<br />
              And on a bitter night, murdered Godwyn the Golden.<br />
              That was the first recorded Death of a demigod in all history.<br />
              And it became the catalyst. Soon, the Elden Ring was smashed, and thus sprang forth the war known as the Shattering.<br />
              I once wished to become a scholar, you see. I've spent many an hour scouring the archives for knowledge of that fateful plot.<br />
              The world has grown crooked, and if you intend to put it to rights,<br />
              You'd better understand what happened to make it this way, mm? </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">This...is a black knifeprint!<br />
              I can scarcely believe you managed to get your hands on this!<br />
              You recall our conversation about the Night of the Black Knives, yes?<br />
              They say the assassins who carried out the deed were scions of the Eternal City.<br />
              A group entirely of women, arrayed in armour of silver under cloaks which fooled the eye.<br />
              The knives they wielded though, were imparted with the power of the Rune of Death through sinister rite.<br />
              Please, I beg of you, lend me the knifeprint for a time.<br />
              I'd love nothing more than to tease out its secrets.<br />
              Though only a fragment, a very specific ritual had to be performed to impart the power of the Rune of Death.<br />
              Traces of the one who performed the rite are sure to remain in the imprint...<br />
              Half my body has been suffused with Death. I'm certain it will help me see. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Oh, still need something? </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Always good to see you safe.<br />
              So. What do you need? </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Ah, so you've met D.<br />
              D is an old friend.<br />
              We found ourselves journeying together for a time, bound by our exploration of Death.<br />
              But our paths have since diverged. Never again to cross.<br />
              Though that's hardly an uncommon fate for two friends. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Pleased to meet you.<br />
              The name's Rogier. A sorcerer, by trade.<br />
              But now I'm in this sorry state.<br />
              I had a little mishap, and now I can't move.<br />
              As you might guess, it's far from ideal... </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Ah, I know.<br />
              I'm privy to a few magical battle arts.<br />
              Would you care to learn one?<br />
              Time can move rather slowly, stuck here, you know.<br />
              A little conversation goes a long way. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Ahh, hello. I was hoping to see you.<br />
              My examination is complete. Here's the knifeprint back, with my thanks.<br />
              Now, I have a fairly good idea who performed the rite upon the blade. The person who orchestrated the Night of the Black Knives.<br />
              Lunar Princess Ranni. One of the children born to King Consort Radagon and his first wife, Renalla.<br />
              Demigod and sister to General Radahn and Praetor Rykard.<br />
              Her's was the name I discovered in the imprint.<br />
              Truly, you have my thanks.<br />
              But, if I might be so bold, I would also like to ask something more of you.<br />
              If Ranni truly is the one who plotted that fateful night,<br />
              then she should bear the cursemark of Destined Death somewhere upon her flesh.<br />
              I would like you to procure it for me.<br />
              And then all will be laid bare. I will have the answers I have sought for so long.<br />
              Don't fret, it is entirely in accordance with the guidance of grace.<br />
              If you seek to stand before the Elden Ring and become Elden Lord,<br />
              The answers you find will surely bolster your chances. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">I have some idea of Ranni's potential whereabouts.<br />
              There's a manor to the north of the Academy of Raya Lucaria.<br />
              It is the familial home of the Carian royals from whom Ranni descends.<br />
              There's been talk of the old royals' vassals gathering there in recent years<br />
              Ranni's whereabouts since the Shattering are a well-kept secret. She hasn't been seen even once.<br />
              But I suspect she might have returned to the manor in which she was born... </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">If Lunar Princess Ranni truly is the one who plotted that fateful night,<br />
              then she should bear the cursemark of Destined Death somewhere upon her flesh.<br />
              Would you be willing to procure it for me?<br />
              She may have returned to the manor that is her home.<br />
              The Royal Carian residence to the north of the Academy of Raya Lucaria. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">I'm afraid there's something I must tell you.<br />
              Do you know of Those Who Live in Death?<br />
              The very notion of life in death defies the Golden Order.<br />
              By D's account, these defiled fiends must be expunged.<br />
              But truth be told, I seek the cursemark to save them.<br />
              You may find this peculiar,<br />
              but I discovered something in my examination of the Night of the Black Knives.<br />
              These souls have committed no offence. They have every right to life, only, they happened to touch upon a flaw in the Order. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Yes, indeed.<br />
              If D knew what drives me now,<br />
              he would surely boil over with rage.<br />
              Or perhaps, he would even feel some pity.<br />
              But no need to fret, none of that will come to pass.<br />
              I can tell a good lie when I need to. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">And...that thing is to blame for the shape I'm in now...<br />
              I urge the utmost caution. Don't disturb the corpse more than necessary... </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Oh? Forgot something, did you? </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Alright there. Good to see you safe. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">I see...<br />
              When Ranni shed her flesh, she shed the cursemark, too.<br />
              You know, not everyone would trust such a tale...<br />
              But, if she in her current form is nothing more than the living doll you profess...<br />
              Then perhaps it's true after all.<br />
              Hmm.<br />
              Forgive the bluntness of the notion, but...<br />
              How would you like to become one of Ranni's vassals?<br />
              Ah, only in order to get what we want, of course.<br />
              The location of the body which bore the cursemark, which right now I haven't the faintest.<br />
              And the best way to find out is for you to enter her service and take a poke around on the sly.<br />
              I know you've got what it takes.<br />
              Not only are you a superb fighter, but people want to trust you. I've seen it. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Can you become Ranni's vassal to advance our agenda?<br />
              While in her service, you'll be able to take a poke around on the sly.<br />
              And determine the location of her original body that bears the cursemark.<br />
              I realise that I'm asking you to put yourself in grave danger.<br />
              But I know you've got what it takes. Quite possibly the only one, in fact.<br />
              Not only are you a superb fighter, but people want to trust you. I've seen it. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">D was telling me.<br />
              That he discovered the mark of the centipede.<br />
              The centipede is an ancient symbol of the cursemark.<br />
              As long as whoever finds and uses it is not nefarious by nature,<br />
              then we may be able to form an alliance.<br />
              If only I could speak to them in person.<br />
              And if they were like you, all the better. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Hmm. Maybe I should tell you.<br />
              Lately, I feel I'm on the precipice...<br />
              Of falling into a deep...fathomless slumber.<br />
              And I have an inkling it could spell trouble for you, somehow.<br />
              So I just wanted to get the apology out of the way, beforehand.<br />
              Since you're so scary and all. </p>

              The Order of the Erdtree and the fate of the moon were conjoined, and all the wounds of war forgiven.<br />
              This miracle blesses the church to this day.<br />
              And so, you need only follow Radagon's example,<br />

              He came to these lands at the head of a great golden host, when he met Lady Rennala in battle.<br />
              He soon repented his territorial aggressions though, and became husband to the Carian Queen.<br />
              However. When Godfrey, first Elden Lord, was hounded from the Lands Between,<br />
              Radagon left Rennala to return to the Erdtree Capital, becoming Queen Marika's second husband and King Consort.<br />
              Taking the title...of second Elden Lord.<br />
              The mystery endures, to this day...<br />
              As to why Lord Radagon would cast Lady Rennala aside...<br />
              And moreover...why a mere champion would be chosen for the seat of Elden Lord... </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">You know, it's said that Lord Radagon harboured a secret...<br />

              She is Queen, head of the Carian royal family, and governor of the Academy of Raya Lucaria.<br />
              The great and beautiful Full Moon Witch.<br />
              Sadly, her heart was broken when Lord Radagon left her.<br />
              And then, when the academy rebelled against the royals, she was locked away in the grand library. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">In the end, Lady Rennala was left alone, cradling the amber egg Lord Radagon bequeathed her.<br />
              Now she devotes herself to it through forbidden rite;<br />
              the grim art of reincarnation.<br />
              You would do well to remember...<br />

              You've seen that structure to the north, towering over the water?<br />
              That's the Academy of Raya Lucaria. Where we study glintstone sorceries.<br />
              Only, its doors have been closed for quite some time now.<br />
              After they declared they wouldn't interfere with the Shattering,<br />
              the academy cast repelling seals on the east gate leading to the Capital and the south gate leading here.<br />
              As you might have guessed, the seals are still active,<br />
              making entry to the academy impossible without a glintstone key.<br />
              And so I'm stuck here. A fledgling sorcerer, with little chance of acquiring a key.<br />
              When they cast the seals, I'd just popped out, and now I'm uprooted from my place of learning. </p>

              Nepheli Loux. We met at Stormveil.<br />
              I'm glad to see you here. I have something for you.<br />
              I found it in Godrick's grafting grounds.<br />
              You were the one to defeat him, I would hazard?<br />
              Make good use of it.<br />
              I don't intend to make a habit of scavenging corpses. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Ah, yes.<br />
              I wonder if you've met my foster father?<br />
              He's in his study. The room Ensha's guarding just over there.<br />
              If you haven't already, I advise you introduce yourself.<br />
              Father is leader of the Roundtable.<br />
              I'm sure talking to him will be worth your while. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">It's about time I headed off.<br />
              I'll see you again, warrior, should the fates deign it. </p>

          <p class="lore">You again...<br />
              You received a summons to the Roundtable?<br />
              Nepheli Loux. We met at Stormveil.<br />
              The pleasure's mine, as a fellow Tarnished, guided by grace to the Roundtable Hold. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Oh, hello.<br />
              I've not seen you here before.<br />
              I am Nepheli Loux. Warrior.<br />
              Here by decree of my father.<br />

              One that affects the heart, I'd wager.<br />
              If it's what I think, I have no need of it.<br />
              I am a warrior.<br />
              I need no external aid.<br />
              Not to brave the horrors of battle. Nor to bolster my resolve. </p>

              Well, what do you make of it? What's happened to this village?<br />
              I witnessed a sight much the same, in my infancy.<br />
              The oppression of the weak. Murder and pillage unchecked.<br />
              A waking nightmare, made by men. </p>

              Right. It's true. My father cast me out.<br />

              Father...rather, Lord Gideon has offered me guidance all my life.<br />
              I would have done anything for him, to place him on the throne of Elden Lord.<br />
              And yet I... Though it was not my intent...<br />
              I betrayed him... </p>

              He once told me that if he became Elden Lord,<br />
              he would never allow the downtrodden to be cheated ever again.<br />
              Was he simply lying to me? </p>

              You, on the other hand, have your own home, which is a far cry from here.<br />
              So far, in fact, that it cannot be further marred by your touch.<br />
              The Shattering caused a great many fools to overstep their bounds.<br />
              Their impudence led to insurgency against Morgott, Lord of Grace. They raised an army, and sought to lay siege to this sacred ground.<br />
              But do you see where it got them? King Morgott's rule would not be shaken!<br />
              Their attempt to defile the capital failed, and while we revelled in eternal grace,<br />
              the traitors were eyed by the grotesque Fell Omen, and their corpses piled high outside the wall!<br />
              The lesson here is self-evident.<br />

              Very well. I permit your stay in the capital for the time being.<br />
              And in the name of the house of Shanehaight, I beseech you hunt down the foul Omen.<br />
              The Undercapital is a repository of waste.<br />
              For ages it's teemed with repulsive Omen. Fiendlings, even, who've never lost a horn.<br />
              And what's worse, they've taken to bellowing in a most blood-curdling manner. You can hear it all the way up here.<br />
              A vile, ceaseless affront to the Erdtree's sanctity. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Get on with it, then.<br />
              Hunt down the vile Omen scurrying about in the Undercapital, and give us peace from those wretched howls.<br />
              I know you can do it. Do not dishonour House Shanehaight. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Haven't set off to hunt the Omen yet?<br />
              Well, you're certainly dragging your heels more than I foresaw.<br />
              I forgive you.<br />
              We Shanehaights are known for patience, a virtue amongst the noble. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Haven't set off to hunt the Omen yet?<br />
              That wretched screeching... I feel as if I could go mad. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Ohh, there you are, pleased to see you.<br />
              You must've expunged the Omen from the repository.<br />
              Otherwise their revolting screeches would still be affronting my ears.<br />
              Well, you've done us a fine service, I must say.<br />
              The Erdbishops will be very pleased to hear it.<br />
              No, this is above their station...<br />
              If I explained that this was all my idea,<br />
              I could be granted audience with Morgott, Lord of Grace.<br />
              What a wondrous opportunity.<br />
              That a viscount as myself might be seen by the Lord of Grace.<br />
              Such an honour will place me amongst the most venerated Shanehaights. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Oh, very sorry, I almost forgot about you completely.<br />
              This Shanehaight heirloom has been held for generations.<br />
              It is yours now, a reward for your fearless execution of my request. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">I'm afraid its worth might be lost on a Tarnished, but...<br />
              For everything, there is a first. For you, and for House Shanehaight, and its newfound glory. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Now, I need to get myself ready.<br />
              If fortune favours me, and I am seen by the Lord of Grace,<br />
              I'd be put to shame if I didn't look my very best. </p>

          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">So, you gave Millicent a golden arm replacement…<br />
              This is a wonderful development.<br />
              Thank you for your kindness.<br />
              Now Millicent may fully realise her true warrior's potential.<br />
              Like her beautiful mother. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">The girl, Millicent. She is a bud.<br />
              Green and undeveloped, waiting to flower into magnificence.<br />
              What a wondrous day that will be.<br />
              In truth, before her, I'd never seen a bud of such superior quality.<br />
              She might very well outshine her sisters. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Do you have an interest in rot incantations?<br />
              Then you might like to learn something of the history...<br />
              of Malenia, goddess of scarlet rot. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Queen Marika and her King Consort Radagon were blessed with twin demigods, and Malenia was one of them.<br />
              She was born an Empyrean, carrying the scarlet rot.<br />
              An Empyrean...is no mere demigod.<br />
              In the age of the Elden Ring, and Queen Marika,<br />
              the precious Empyrean was born. A new god to forge a new Order.<br />
              Since Malenia fought Radahn, and the great scarlet flower blossomed in Aeonia, I have dedicated myself to her.<br />
              And to the resplendence of the Order of Rot. The cycle of decay and rebirth. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Oh, Millicent. Finding herself, is she?<br />
              The words of a true innocent, the dear girl.<br />
              Well, perhaps this is just as it should be.<br />
              Little Millicent, following in the steps of her mother, no matter what.<br />
              This is their fate, after all. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">

          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Oh, mm, I didn't notice you there.<br />
              Welcome. How may I help you?<br />
              My apologies though, you hardly needed to see me like that. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Oh, it's just…<br />
              I realised that I'd soon be saying my goodbyes to Millicent, and…<br />
              My eyes began to well...<br />
              She is to meet them very soon. Her sisters.<br />
              And when she does, she'll be defeated, surely, and begin to flower.<br />
              Which is why...<br />
              If you happen to be present for the girl's fight with her sisters,<br />
              I ask that you side with the sisters and kill Millicent.<br />
              It must be done by your hand; no other.<br />
              Millicent trusts you, rather deeply in fact.<br />
              Sever that trust. Nurtured by betrayal, her bud will flower most vividly.<br />
              When Malenia ascends to godhood, Millicent too shall be reborn.<br />
              As a scarlet valkyrie. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Thus, I have a request of the utmost import.<br />
              I beg you, kill Millicent.<br />
              Before the girl can meet her sisters.<br />
              There is no other way. It must be done by your hand alone.<br />
              You seem to have sown a seed in Millicent's heart.<br />
              Which will flower most vividly, should she be plucked by you.<br />
              Malenia will be a goddess. And once she is, Millicent will flower anew, as a scarlet valkyrie. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">You can't tell me you don't wish to see it.<br />
              The superior bud that is Millicent, becoming the finest of flowers?<br />
              I beg of you, kill her. With your own two hands. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Welcome, welcome. How may I help you?<br />

                  Millicent, my daughter.<br />
                  Why would you take out the needle?<br />
                  You were so close. So very close. To becoming the fairest of all flowers.<br />
                  Would you disown us too? As your Mother did?<br />
                  We children of the scarlet rot?

              So that one day, if a Tarnished of the Roundtable Hold should become Elden Lord, I might counsel them,<br />

              And now, I hear he has come to the Lands Between alone, to contemplate the Golden Order...<br />
              I wish nothing more than to seek his instruction, and perhaps even help him in his research. </p>

              Now the master is facing quite the puzzle.<br />
              The Golden Order is founded on the principle that Marika is the one true god. However...<br />
              The name of Marika's second husband, King Consort Radagon, also appeared...<br />

              Curse my mediocre mind.<br />
              The master only has me, and here I fail him... </p>

              So I'd like to pass this on to you instead.<br />
              A glimpse into the heart of the Golden Order, documented by yours truly. </p>

              Sadly, I cannot comprehend it, myself.<br />

              Thought I'd set up shop here for a time.<br />
              A pleasure, as ever. Care to purchase anything? </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">We meet again, I see.<br />
              It's me, Kalé.<br />
              Thought I'd set up shop here for a time.<br />
              Right then. Care to purchase anything? </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Have you seen a crow around here by any chance?<br />
              You know, a burial crow, with a letter fastened to its claw?<br />
              Well, if you do set eyes upon it, I'll buy that letter from you, no question.<br />
              I'd give you a generous sum for it, of course. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">My thanks. I've been wanting to get my hands on this.<br />
              And I was willing to pay whatever was needed. Your reward, as promised. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">So, about the letter you brought me...<br />
              It's just as I suspected, it features a cryptogram of my people.<br />
              And I'm sure it's come from wherever the Great Caravan disappeared to.<br />
              This could be my chance to get close to it.<br />
              Thanks to you. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Once I decipher that cryptogram, I'll be packing up shop again.<br />
              Don't worry, I'll leave a sign that shows where I've gone.<br />
              With any luck, I'll see you there, eh. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">I've always preferred my own company, to that of other people's...<br />
              And I don't have any burning questions I wish to ask my ancestors...<br />
              But there's something I need to know.<br />
              My roots.<br />
              I want to know who I am. Where I came from. Where I'm headed. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Ah, good to see you.<br />
              I knew leaving the sign would be worth the trouble.<br />
              The shop is all set up.<br />
              A pleasure as ever. Care to purchase anything? </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Oh yes, about the cryptogram from the letter...<br />
              I think it's pointing underneath the capital.<br />
              I think it's pointing here, underneath the capital.<br />
              But I'm perplexed as to the path to take down there.<br />
              Well, the journey can wait, I suppose.<br />
              I'll settle here for the time being, and start looking into it. </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Where...did you find this letter? </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">I can't imagine how it ended up there...<br />
              But the well might just lead under the capital.<br />
              To the spot indicated by the cryptogram from the letter.<br />
              Seems like an odd place for the Great Caravan...<br />
              But no amount of thinking will change anything. I'll be heading straight there, after some preparation.<br />
              Once again, I find myself in your debt.<br />
              Take this, as a token of my appreciation.<br />
              It's not from my usual stock, but something rather more special.<br />
              I hope you can join me at the Great Caravan, in fact.<br />
              Who knows what wonders there might be to trade? </p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p class="lore">Ah, you, is it...<br />
              Did you see? What they did to my ancestors?<br />

              Have you heard their moans? They're hardly human anymore.<br />
              They think we worship the Three Fingers? That we called the maddening sickness down upon them?<br />
              Well. If that's what they expect from us, then that's what they shall get from us! <br />
              The world of grace and its people should have been content to see us sink between the cracks.<br />
              But to have intruded upon our solace... Having broken us upon their whims...<br />
              I'll never forgive any of you. </p>

              I should have known, you scheming little thief.<br />

          <p class="lore cut">He he he he he...<br />
              My sincerest gratitude. I thought I'd never wrench that thing open.<br />

              This is how you die, you disgusting Tarnished.<br />
              Don't worry, I've got big plans for you. After you snuff it... </p>

              But don't raise your hopes;<br />

              I lost my appetite for them a lifetime ago, or more. </p>

              A new child, Mother's newborn.<br />
              A new friend. A new playmate for us.<br />
              Just watch, he'll be born again.<br />
              Just watch, she'll be born again.<br />
              Then Mother will hold him tight.<br />
              Then Mother will hold her tight.<br />
              He'll be so warm, warm and cosy.<br />
              She'll be so warm, warm and cosy.<br />
              That'd be nice, so very nice.<br />
              If we're turned to stone, will we be born again?<br />
              Will Mother hold us again?<br />
              Will we? Will she?<br />

              Maybe she's something else?<br />
              Can we still be friends, if we try?<br />
              Yes, we can be friends, I'm sure.<br />
              He'll understand, if we just explain.<br />
