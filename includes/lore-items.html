            <p>With a Whetstone Knife, you can use ashes of war to grant affinities to your armaments at sites of grace.</p>
            <p>This way, you can alter an armament's attack affinity, boost attribute scaling, and more.</p>
            <p>An armament's type determines what affinities it can have. Some special armaments, like those with unique skills, cannot be granted new affinities.</p>

                There's a festival being held at the castle on the southern edge of the Caelid Wilds, east of Limgrave.<br />
                It's a festival of combat. And I heard...that you can fight Radahn himself. He who was once called the strongest of all the demigods...<br />
                Maybe it's just a coincidence, but I think it's worth investigating.<br />
                I'll be on my way to this festival of Radahn then... </p>

            <p class="lore">You're coming too, right? To Radahn's festivities...<br />
                I'll meet you at Redmane Castle in Caelid.<br />

                This territory once belonged to the Carian royal family. Their manor lies not far beyond this point.<br />
                When the Raya Lucaria Academy turned on the Carians, the Knights of the Cuckoo descended on this tract.<br />
                After leveling it, they carried on to the manor.<br />
                The Carians were taken off guard, but their strength had not waned, and they repelled the knights' onslaught...<br />
                By conjuring an enchanted snare that remains potent to this day.<br />
                That is why I say, Tarnished. Don't go near the manor.<br />

                They were always happy to have me tag along, as well.<br />

                Before taking up the banner of General Radahn, he was a guest of the Carian royal family.<br />
                An expert swordsman, to be sure, but ever the eccentric.<br />
                No surprise he'd get wrapped up in some festival.<br />

                I ought to retire as war counsellor for such a gross oversight!<br />
                Let me explain. The fate of the Carian royal family is guided by the stars.<br />
                As is the fate of Lady Ranni, first heir in the Carian royal line.<br />
                But General Radahn is the conqueror of the stars.<br />
                Who stood up to the swirling constellations, halting their movement in a smashing victory.<br />
                And so, if General Radahn were defeated, the stars would once again resume their movement.<br />
                As would Lady Ranni's destiny.<br />
                Perhaps, even, revealing the elusive path. That leads to Nokron. </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">My apologies for the misleading words of warning.<br />
                I never imagined that an audience, let alone service to Lady Ranni was in your fate.<br />
                I, for one, should have seen it, but I did not.<br />
                Do forgive me, my fellow.<br />
                Let us give all that we can of ourselves.<br />

            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">Something else for you? </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">Go with Blaidd to the festival grounds.<br />
                Should General Radahn be defeated, the stars would once again resume their movement.<br />
                Perhaps revealing the elusive path to Nokron. </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">Ah, you've finally come. Blaidd told me everything.<br />
                You've defeated General Radahn, unlocking the stars.<br />
                The General was blighted by scarlet rot and driven to madness, but not long ago he was hailed as the mightiest demigod of them all.<br />
                There is no parallel to your achievement. Nor to Lady Ranni's acute judgement of character.<br />
                Thanks to you, Lady Ranni's fate once again stirs, and the path to Nokron has opened.<br />
                Descend underground where the fallen star struck Limgrave.<br />
                And make it yours. The precious treasure of Nokron. </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">Oh, Blaidd wanted me to tell you.<br />
                Not to bother waiting for him, and head straight to Nokron.<br />
                Blaidd has been given an important task.<br />
                Apparently, a matter of great urgency. </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">You need not await Blaidd.<br />
                Descend underground alone where the fallen star struck Limgrave.<br />
                And make it yours. The precious treasure of Nokron.<br />
                So that Lady Ranni may tread the dark path of the Empyrean. </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">Now the festival is over, and General Radahn is defeated...<br />
                Jerren's duties are finally fulfilled.<br />
                Though we served different masters, I could see he was truly adept in his role.<br />
                Now the time has come to remind him of an old promise made.<br />
                With the stars of fate set into motion, a certain sorceress is dispossessed of her immortality...<br />
                Finally, we can be rid of a longstanding Carian weed... </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">Jerren. Now, that's a name I haven't heard for a while.<br />
                Before taking up the banner of General Radahn, he was a guest of the Carian royal family.<br />
                An expert swordsman, to be sure, but ever the eccentric.<br />
                It's funny how things happen.<br />
                Jerren and I parted ways long, long ago, yet here he is, playing his part in Lady Ranni's fate.<br />
                I'm afraid I never saw it coming. And I thought myself a capable war counsellor... </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">I presume you've spoken with Blaidd?<br />
                Very well. There is something you should know.<br />
                The Two Fingers gave Blaidd to Lady Ranni, as a faithful follower. Her very shadow, incapable of treachery.<br />
                But if Lady Ranni, as an Empyrean, resists being an instrument of the Two Fingers,<br />
                the shadow will go mad, transforming from a follower into a horrid curse.<br />
                But such is his destiny. In such matters, Blaidd's own thoughts hold no weight.<br />
                It pains me so, but he must be neutralised. For Lady Ranni's sake. </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">Unthinkable, how could Blaidd...<br />
                How did he break free from his cell?<br />
                No, more importantly...<br />
                Blaidd became a curse that plagued Lady Ranni, yet even in madness, gave himself to her.<br />
                I've made a grave misjudgment. And I thought myself a capable war counsellor...<br />
                I'll catch up with you soon enough, Blaidd.<br />
                When I do, I only hope you'll accept my apology. </p>

                Now, perhaps the time has come to tell you.<br />
                Of the true ruler of this manor, Lord Rykard.<br />
                The Erdtree blessed the Tarnished with grace.<br />
                But it was all too meagre, in the face of the enormity of their task.<br />
                The Tarnished were forced to scavenge, squabbling for crumbs.<br />
                Like the shardbearers, vying for power in the wake of the Shattering.<br />
                Our Lord, indignant, has refused. To scurry about, fighting over what miserly scraps they allow us.<br />
                If the Erdtree, and indeed the very gods, would debase us so,<br />
                then we are willing to raise the banner of resistance, even if it means heresy.<br />
                We at the Volcano Manor, under Lord Rykard, have sworn no rest until it is done.<br />
                If you follow this heroic path, one day the Lord will see you.<br />
                The Lord's visits with our champions are always a spectacle.<br />
                It cannot come a day too soon! </p>

                That some things are better left unknown. Besides, no-one should be blamed for their heritage.<br />

                Now's as good a time as any. I'll let you in on it.<br />
                There's a glintstone sorcerer by the name of Sellen in Limgrave.<br />
                She owes me for the help I gave her when she was expelled from the academy.<br />
                I asked her to look into the matter some time ago.<br />
                I'll write you a letter of introduction. Go ask her. </p>

            <p class="lore">So, you had Nepheli drink the potion? Truly?<br />
                Hmm. Then perhaps something was amiss with it.<br />
                It's concocted from the finest ingredients. But perhaps I should review the recipe.<br />

                You tricked Nepheli, and had her drink the potion.<br />
                I believe that makes you my accomplice.<br />

                All you really wanted was a puppet to cherish. To fill that hole deep in your heart.<br />

                If you can manage it, I'll gladly prepare a new puppet for you.<br />
                The soul of every puppet has its own ambience. You'll soon come to know, once you possess a few.<br />

                And get this. A surviving virgin sits at the bottom of the big waterwheel in the Academy of Raya Lucaria.<br />
                Its transpositional powers fully intact.<br />
                So, right, if you get caught in it on purpose...<br />
                It'll chuck you out straight at the base of the Erdtree... Or so I'm told...<br />

                You were trapped inside a volcano, no mistake,<br />
                but the Erdtree was right outside. You just had to spring yourself out.<br />
                I'm willing to admit. I could have been more clear.<br />
                But I did not lie, and you're perfectly unscathed. All's well that ends well, right? </p>

                I'll give Tanith the news.<br />

                Not to mention Tanith has always made me curious.<br />
                I guess her master must really be something, cause she's pretty damn smug about it.<br />
                Even after announcing her blasphemous ambitions, she still stands proud.<br />

                Cripes, you make this nonsense seem, well, less nonsensical...<br />

                Instead, you must seek the old ruins in the cliff.<br />
                At the base of the valley near the Grand Lift, there's an old tunnel.<br />
                It was excavated from both ends, linking Liurnia to the Altus Plateau.<br />
                I have faith in you. A champion, through and through.<br />
                I do hope that we can meet again. </p>

                    Lady Tanith speaks no falsehoods, and the Volcano Manor is just as it seems.

                Revenge is not the answer.<br />
                According to Lady Tanith...<br />
                I've got the stuff of champions.<br />
                And champions, ironic as it is, are oft forced to walk a tainted path.<br />
                It hit me like a bolt from the blue...<br />
                That my former thoughts were simple naivet√©.<br />
                Of course, my heart weeps for Lanya.<br />
                That unfortunate incident was a cruel twist of fate indeed.<br />
                But succumbing to the pain and sadness caused won't
                make me a champion, will it.<br />
                Lanya knows this, I'm certain. Fate has laid hard roads for us both.<br />
                But such is true of any road trod by champions. </p>

                Glintstone is the amber of the cosmos.<br />
                Golden amber contains the remnants of ancient life, and houses its vitality,<br />
                while glintstone contains residual life, and thus the vitality of the stars.<br />
                It should not be forgotten,<br />
                that glintstone sorcery is the study of the stars, and the life therein.<br />

                The stars alter the fate of the Carian royal family. And the fate of your mistress, Ranni.<br />

                Now, he is the force that repulses the stars.<br />
                If General Radahn were to die, the stars would resume their movement.<br />
                And so, too, would Ranni's destiny. </p>

            <p class="lore">Greetings. Nice to see you again.<br />
                My name is Roderika. I should have told you sooner.<br />
                Isn't this place impressive, though?<br />
                The Roundtable Hold, covert quarters of the Two Fingers, and gathering place of champions who vie to become Elden Lord.<br />
                I never knew the guidance bestowed upon us Tarnished had such fantastic roots.<br />
                Although, it's all a bit much for me, in truth.<br />
                I'm still looking for my own purpose. </p>

            <p class="lore">You're telling me I possess some kind of gift?<br />
                I don't believe you. But...<br />
                If I do have this talent, and goodness knows it would be my first...<br />
                I suppose I should try to hone it. Shouldn't I?<br />
                I'll ask Master Hewg to teach me.<br />
                Certainly, he does appear intimidating, and holds no love for us Tarnished...<br />
                But I know he's trapped here, at the Roundtable Hold... So...<br />
                I can tell. He's a gentle soul, underneath it all. </p>

                Please, allow to me to express my thanks.<br />
                For giving me that keepsake from my men.<br />
                It was as if I was frozen with self-pity. I failed them at every turn.<br />

                I can happily announce that he has taught me the noble toil of spirit tuning.<br />
                I'm as yet unsure of what I might be able to accomplish,<br />
                but if I might be any help to you all, I'd certainly like to try.<br />
                And if there's any chance to ease the suffering of my dear men who were grafted...<br />
                Well, I certainly must try.<br />

            <p class="lore">Greetings.<br />
                Are you here for spirit tuning? </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">I feel like I'm really coming to grips with spirit tuning of late.<br />
                I can see how and why immortal essence exists as spirit under the Golden Order.<br />
                I can understand their yearnings, what they become drawn to...<br />
                Master Hewg said it himself, actually, that I'm no mere prentice any longer.<br />
                <br />
                Once again, I'm pleased to make your acquaintance. Roderika the certified spirit tuner.

                Can you take this little one along with you?<br />
                Can you take these little ones along with you?<br />
                They can't be summoned here.<br />
                But the spirits look rather fondly upon you.<br />
                It'll be glad of your company, I think, the little'un.<br />
                They'd be glad of your company, I think, the little'uns. </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">I need to warn you about something.<br />
                A little while ago someone started lurking in the wing on the opposite side of the roundtable.<br />
                And I can hear, from all the way over there...<br />
                The howling and wailing of spirits in fear of a curse. I can even hear the repulsive, twisted malison itself...<br />
                A plethora of spirits in an unceasing cacophony...<br />
                I can't even imagine. How much suffering, inflicted to who knows how many souls...<br />
                Not even the grafting caused anything like this to happen...<br />
                You should keep your distance.<br />
                I know you're strong, but please... </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">I can hear it from across the wing, past the roundtable...<br />
                The howling and wailing of spirits in fear of the curse. I can even hear the repulsive, twisted malison itself...<br />

            <p class="lore">I can't hear them any more; the voices of the spirits cowering from the curse...<br />
                I suppose the Dung Eater must have left the Roundtable.<br />
                I just pray nothing ill comes of this. </p>

            <p class="lore">Be on your guard, I beg you.<br />
                He's back. The Dung Eater. Again.<br />
                I can hear them; the spirits as they howl and lament in fear of the curse.<br />
                And worse than ever, the reverberations of the twisted malison itself.<br />
                But after all this time, I've started to grasp it now.<br />
                I can hear, in the malison, another fearsome Order. </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">The voices of the tormented spirits are silent again..<br />
                But it isn't like last time.<br />
                I'm almost certain...the spirits have escaped their confinement.<br />
                Did you...have anything to do with it, I wonder? </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">Take a look around. The Roundtable Hold is burned. Razed to the ground.<br />
                The Two Fingers went mad, and the Tarnished have all left.<br />
                Myself and Master Hewg are the only ones who remain.<br />
                Don't worry, I don't blame you.<br />
                I'll continue spirit tuning just the same as before.<br />
                Which is why I need your help persuading Master Hewg to leave.<br />
                His roots are so knotted in this place.<br />
                He won't last much longer if he stays here...<br />
                His shackles are broken. He's a free man, now.<br />
                It's high time he put the Roundtable behind him. </p>

                I'll try and talk him round next time.<br />
                I know he was given this great entreaty;<br />
                To craft a weapon which could slay a god. Though I can't help but think of it as a curse.<br />
                A fearsome curse, put on him by Queen Marika.<br />
                And if that's the case, I'm not sure there's anything we can do... </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">Ah. So it wasn't just me this happened to...<br />
                To think he'd forget who you were, as well.<br />
                I knew he'd burn himself out, old Hewg.<br />
                I think we could talk him into leaving the Roundtable Hold, now.<br />
                But maybe it's better that we don't.<br />
                It's only proper that we respect his choice to stay. </p>

            <p class="lore">I'll remain with Hewg.<br />
                He made me who I am today.<br />

            <p class="lore">Please, become Elden Lord.<br />
                Hewg was always saying that you were a Lord, to him.<br />
                So slay her, with the weapons he smithed.<br />
                Slay the god, Marika, who cursed us all. </p>

                Fret not, the great Kenneth Haight is known for his considerable largesse.<br />

                I would take great care to avoid Godrick's Tarnished hunts, were I in your shoes.<br />
                That depraved lot are obsessed with sacrificing Tarnished like you for the sake of "grafting".<br />
                Honestly, Godrick's nothing more than a jumped up country bumpkin. Lord? Don't make me laugh.<br />
                First he hid himself amongst the womenfolk to flee the capital, then hid from Radahn in that castle...<br />
                Then he insulted Malenia, lost to her in battle, only to lick her boots rather than die like a man.<br />
                Has he no shame, the big girl's blouse?<br />
                And to think, he's the blood of Godfrey! Last of the golden lineage, though you almost wouldn't know it to look at him.<br />
                I almost feel sorry for the chap the more I think of it. </p>

                No, no. Th-the help is very much appreciated. Even from a Tarnished.<br />
                Despite appearances, nobility is no prerequisite to serving the true Order.<br />
                You might have heard of me. Kenneth Haight. Next in line as the rightful ruler of Limgrave.<br />
                Young Tarnished, I would have a boon of you.<br />
                I want you to take back my fort. It lies to the south, beyond the Mistwood.<br />
                A Knight commander from Stormveil took it. A fool, and plumb mad to boot. Simply obsessed with blood! </p>

                One must be found, with haste. And not that awful Godrick.<br />

                Such is the sincere opinion of I, Kenneth Haight, no less.<br />
                For the time being, I share command of the castle with my Lady, but I plan on returning to my fort afterwards.<br />
                At which time I can fulfil my old promise.<br />
                By raising you to the glory of knighthood.<br />
                I hope it is just as wonderful as you imagine. </p>

                I lay with the remains of an exalted noble, to grant him another chance at life.<br />
                To do so is the purpose of my being.<br />
                But before I could bear the noble into new life,<br />
                I was awakened by the guidance of grace, and chased from my birthplace.<br />
                Pray, be kind.<br />
                Despite all that, I still wish to be a Deathbed Companion.<br />

                A certain person gave it to me, as a gift.<br />
                It's a very precious thing. It must have a special place in the owner's heart.<br />

                I can't remember the last time a new Tarnished made their way to the Roundtable.<br />
                Very well. As your senior, I bid you welcome.<br />
                It is safe here. You may let down your guard. </p>

                Then you would do well to remember the first words of grace given to you.<br />
                Stand before the Elden Ring, and become the Elden Lord.<br />
                If those words held any meaning to you...<br />
                Follow the guidance of grace, lay low the shardbearers, and claim for yourself a Great Rune.<br />
                Do so, and the doors to the Roundtable's inner chamber will open.<br />

                The inheritors of the Great Runes; the shardbearers.<br />
                We of the Roundtable know the location of five of them, including the one you defeated.<br />
                Godrick the Grafted, Lord of Stormveil.<br />
                General Radahn, who fought Malenia and her rot to a standstill in the Caelid Wilds.<br />

                Morgott the Grace-Given, Veiled Monarch and Lord of Leyndell.<br />
                And Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon, ruler of Raya Lucaria's Academy.<br />
                ...You'll still be after more Great Runes, won't you? </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">So. Godrick the Grafted, Lord of Stormveil.<br />
                Despite being the blood of Godfrey, first Elden Lord, he's a grotesque old fool, grasping for power.<br />
                His castle lies upon the cliff to Limgrave's northwest.<br />
                ...but I suspect you know that well enough already. </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">General Radahn, the famed Red Lion and scourge of the stars, is a ferocious warrior.<br />
                He fought Malenia and her rot to a standstill in the Caelid Wilds to Limgrave's east.<br />
                And now Caelid has been engulfed by the scarlet rot, even approaching the region is no mean feat.<br />
                I've heard survivors of Radahn's army are still in the wilds, staving off the rot with fire.<br />
                And if it's true, I suspect Radahn is still there as well, in Caelid.<br />
                Though I doubt he much resembles his former self anymore... </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">Praetor Rykard is the Lord of the Volcano Manor on Mt. Gelmir.<br />
                He is a ruthless justiciar who commands a company of inquisitors, reviled for his serpentine demeanour.<br />
                The volcano, Mt. Gelmir, lies in the west of the Altus Plateau; the realm of the Erdtree.<br />
                It was the stage of the most appalling battle in the entirety of the Shattering.<br />
                Rykard has committed the grave sin of blasphemy. Marking himself as an enemy, never to be forgiven. </p>

                But the Two Fingers forbid us from venturing there.<br />
                Until we've acquired enough Great Runes to repair the Elden Ring.<br />
                Set your sights elsewhere for the time being. The Veiled Monarch can wait. </p>

                But Rennala herself is no demigod.<br />
                She is merely the recipient of an amber egg, given to her by Radagon,<br />
                Her beloved, Radagon, left her to become Queen Marika's second husband, taking the title of King Consort.<br />
                The Great Rune dwells within the amber egg that was Radagon's gift to her. </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">There are four more demigods yet to be located.<br />

                We both desire to stand before the Elden Ring, and become Elden Lord.<br />
                As such, I hope we are compelled to work together.<br />
                I'll trade your findings for something rather special. </p>

                To the capital Leyndell, that lies to the east of the Altus Plateau, at the foot of the Erdtree.<br />
                The Two Fingers will deny your passage no longer.<br />
                You may be our best hope. Find your way to the Elden Ring.<br />

                Though a mere axe-wielding barbarian, her youthful credulity suited my purposes.<br />
                So I put her to work.<br />
                Do not hesitate to employ her, should her services benefit you.<br />
                Despite her looks, she is more than capable in the press of battle. </p>

                Honestly, what's a man to do.<br />
                A determined plebian is more wicked than an Omen horn, quite frankly.<br />
                I suspect...that's just what the Queen wants.<br />
                A dose of ambition, to incite the Tarnished. </p>

                Oh, I won't interfere. You go ahead and do what you must.<br />
                The Roundtable has no code to speak of.<br />
                But, I ask you this. Are you really going to do the bidding of that twisted dolly botherer?<br />
                Or would you rather hand that potion to me, and see if we can't get one over on the bastard? </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">Good. I'll dispose of the potion myself.<br />
                You go and see Seluvis, but don't give anything away.<br />
                Just tell him that you tricked your mark into drinking the potion as planned.<br />
                Despite knowing next to bloody nothing, he's so far up his own arse he won't suspect a thing.<br />
                His inevitable display of arrogance will certainly be a sight to behold. </p>

                But I think your plan would be a dreadful waste.<br />
                She's not herself right now, and though I have no need of her, she still has potential.<br />

                Hah, no need to pay me for that gift.<br />
                All my knowledge is for the sake of guidance.<br />
                That a Tarnished might stand before the Elden Ring, and become Elden Lord.<br />

                A fitting little squat for that deluded maniac to bleat about the revival of his precious dynasty, while he turns our fellow Tarnished into Bloody Fingers.<br />
                Let him stay there. That way, his delusions will remain as they are - distant and unattainable.<br />
                But perhaps it's worth looking into...<br />

            <p class="lore">Ahh, I see! So Miquella was with the Lord of Blood after all!<br />
                That is some fine intelligence indeed!<br />
                With it, the final clue has been brought into the light.<br />
                One of the last few pieces the Roundtable-- I need, to put everything together.<br />
                As promised, allow me to impart to you<br />
                the last of the hidden treasures known only to me.<br />
                the last of the secret rites known only to me.<br />
                a thing most wondrous, known only to me. </p>

            <p class="lore">Well, I wonder what comes next...<br />
                If he continues his slumber within the cocoon, all would be well.<br />
                But perhaps it would be safer to destroy it.<br />
                Miquella is the one thing that remains a mystery to me... </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">You...burned the Erdtree, didn't you?<br />
                Then the Roundtable is soon to follow.<br />
                Ah, no need to fret about that.<br />
                The Roundtable Hold served to put a Tarnished upon the throne of Elden Lord.<br />
                And if the Erdtree needed to burn for that to happen,<br />
                then the Roundtable must go, as well. </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">I'll stay at the Roundtable, for a time.<br />
                I must learn all that can be taken from this place,<br />
                and sear it into my memory.<br />
                How could I call myself the All-Knowing, if I did any less? </p>

            <p class="lore">The pursuit of knowledge is without end, for knowledge is never a thing complete.<br />
                Thus, I maintain the mantle of All-Knowing.<br />
                Perhaps the same could be said of guidance.<br />
                Who's to say whether we'll remain who we are, once the fight is finished?<br />
                What do you think, as one who aspires to become Elden Lord? </p>

            <p class="lore">Ahh, I knew you'd come.<br />

                I commend your spirit, but alas, none shall take the throne.<br />
                Queen Marika has high hopes for us.<br />

            <p class="lore">Ah, nice to meet you.<br />
                The pleasure's mine. Rogier's the name. A sorcerer, as you might have guessed.<br />
                I'm looking for a little something, here in the castle.<br />
                When I'm not hotfooting it from the troops, that is.<br />
                But enough about me, what are you doing here in Stormveil Castle?<br />
                This place is bristling with Tarnished hunters, you know. They sacrifice our kind, for grafting.<br />
                Not exactly a place I'd stroll into without a purpose in mind... </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">I see. Here to challenge Godrick, and lay your hands upon a Great Rune, are you?<br />
                You can see it then, I take it? The guidance of grace.<br />
                Well, enjoy it while you can.<br />
                I'm Tarnished, like you.<br />
                But unlike you, I've seen neither hide nor hair of this guidance for the longest time.<br />
                Still, I won't forget how it felt when I first came here, to the Lands Between.<br />
                I'm privy to a few magical battle arts.<br />
                Would you care to learn one?<br />
                As a fellow Tarnished, once guided by grace. I'd love to help you out, if it please. </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">Oh? Keen to learn another battle art, are we? </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">Oh hello there, good to see you safe.<br />
                Stopping by to learn a battle art or two? </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">The battle art you've learned is of the glintstone family.<br />
                They were conceived at the great Academy of Raya Lucaria, to the north of this castle.<br />
                In the past, they obeyed laws which contravened the Golden Order, or so I'm told.<br />
                Fascinating, isn't it?<br />
                That the Golden Order was pliable enough to absorb practices that contradicted itself in the past.<br />
                With the Order broken, twisted, and in need of repair,<br />
                such adaptability is more important now than ever. </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">Of course. I understand.<br />
                Why place trust in a perfect stranger?<br />
                Be safe, then, stranger.<br />
                Watch you don't get sacrificed, eh. I'll do the same. </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">Oh? Something bothering you?<br />
                Or are you just trying to pass the time?<br />
                I'm curious how you ended up inside this castle. </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">Ah, we meet again after all.<br />
                I apologise for any offence given by my bearing, but I'm quite unable to move, you see.<br />
                So. What do you need? </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">Ah, you defeated Godrick and claimed yourself a Great Rune.<br />
                Mm, looks like we both got we wanted out of Stormveil, didn't we.<br />
                Well done, friend.<br />
                Something to mark the occasion. Go on, take it.<br />
                As you might've guessed, I still can't move. My fighting days are behind me.<br />
                No need to be polite, I've no use for it anymore. </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">The misshapen corpse under Stormveil?<br />
                That is a sacred relic. Of the black knives plot. As that famed night of assassination is known.<br />
                It happened during the Golden Age of the Erdtree, long before the shattering of the Elden Ring.<br />
                Someone stole a fragment of the Rune of Death from Maliketh, the Black Blade.<br />
                And on a bitter night, murdered Godwyn the Golden.<br />
                That was the first recorded Death of a demigod in all history.<br />
                And it became the catalyst. Soon, the Elden Ring was smashed, and thus sprang forth the war known as the Shattering.<br />
                I once wished to become a scholar, you see. I've spent many an hour scouring the archives for knowledge of that fateful plot.<br />
                The world has grown crooked, and if you intend to put it to rights,<br />
                You'd better understand what happened to make it this way, mm? </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">This...is a black knifeprint!<br />
                I can scarcely believe you managed to get your hands on this!<br />
                You recall our conversation about the Night of the Black Knives, yes?<br />
                They say the assassins who carried out the deed were scions of the Eternal City.<br />
                A group entirely of women, arrayed in armour of silver under cloaks which fooled the eye.<br />
                The knives they wielded though, were imparted with the power of the Rune of Death through sinister rite.<br />
                Please, I beg of you, lend me the knifeprint for a time.<br />
                I'd love nothing more than to tease out its secrets.<br />
                Though only a fragment, a very specific ritual had to be performed to impart the power of the Rune of Death.<br />
                Traces of the one who performed the rite are sure to remain in the imprint...<br />
                Half my body has been suffused with Death. I'm certain it will help me see. </p>

            <p class="lore">Ah, so you've met D.<br />
                D is an old friend.<br />
                We found ourselves journeying together for a time, bound by our exploration of Death.<br />
                But our paths have since diverged. Never again to cross.<br />
                Though that's hardly an uncommon fate for two friends. </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">Pleased to meet you.<br />
                The name's Rogier. A sorcerer, by trade.<br />
                But now I'm in this sorry state.<br />
                I had a little mishap, and now I can't move.<br />
                As you might guess, it's far from ideal... </p>

            <p class="lore">Ah, I know.<br />
                I'm privy to a few magical battle arts.<br />
                Would you care to learn one?<br />
                Time can move rather slowly, stuck here, you know.<br />
                A little conversation goes a long way. </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">Ahh, hello. I was hoping to see you.<br />
                My examination is complete. Here's the knifeprint back, with my thanks.<br />
                Now, I have a fairly good idea who performed the rite upon the blade. The person who orchestrated the Night of the Black Knives.<br />
                Lunar Princess Ranni. One of the children born to King Consort Radagon and his first wife, Renalla.<br />
                Demigod and sister to General Radahn and Praetor Rykard.<br />
                Her's was the name I discovered in the imprint.<br />
                Truly, you have my thanks.<br />
                But, if I might be so bold, I would also like to ask something more of you.<br />
                If Ranni truly is the one who plotted that fateful night,<br />
                then she should bear the cursemark of Destined Death somewhere upon her flesh.<br />
                I would like you to procure it for me.<br />
                And then all will be laid bare. I will have the answers I have sought for so long.<br />
                Don't fret, it is entirely in accordance with the guidance of grace.<br />
                If you seek to stand before the Elden Ring and become Elden Lord,<br />
                The answers you find will surely bolster your chances. </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">I have some idea of Ranni's potential whereabouts.<br />
                There's a manor to the north of the Academy of Raya Lucaria.<br />
                It is the familial home of the Carian royals from whom Ranni descends.<br />
                There's been talk of the old royals' vassals gathering there in recent years<br />
                Ranni's whereabouts since the Shattering are a well-kept secret. She hasn't been seen even once.<br />
                But I suspect she might have returned to the manor in which she was born... </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">If Lunar Princess Ranni truly is the one who plotted that fateful night,<br />
                then she should bear the cursemark of Destined Death somewhere upon her flesh.<br />
                Would you be willing to procure it for me?<br />
                She may have returned to the manor that is her home.<br />
                The Royal Carian residence to the north of the Academy of Raya Lucaria. </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">I'm afraid there's something I must tell you.<br />
                Do you know of Those Who Live in Death?<br />
                The very notion of life in death defies the Golden Order.<br />
                By D's account, these defiled fiends must be expunged.<br />
                But truth be told, I seek the cursemark to save them.<br />
                You may find this peculiar,<br />
                but I discovered something in my examination of the Night of the Black Knives.<br />
                These souls have committed no offence. They have every right to life, only, they happened to touch upon a flaw in the Order. </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">Yes, indeed.<br />
                If D knew what drives me now,<br />
                he would surely boil over with rage.<br />
                Or perhaps, he would even feel some pity.<br />
                But no need to fret, none of that will come to pass.<br />
                I can tell a good lie when I need to. </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">And...that thing is to blame for the shape I'm in now...<br />
                I urge the utmost caution. Don't disturb the corpse more than necessary... </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">Oh? Forgot something, did you? </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">Alright there. Good to see you safe. </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">I see...<br />
                When Ranni shed her flesh, she shed the cursemark, too.<br />
                You know, not everyone would trust such a tale...<br />
                But, if she in her current form is nothing more than the living doll you profess...<br />
                Then perhaps it's true after all.<br />
                Hmm.<br />
                Forgive the bluntness of the notion, but...<br />
                How would you like to become one of Ranni's vassals?<br />
                Ah, only in order to get what we want, of course.<br />
                The location of the body which bore the cursemark, which right now I haven't the faintest.<br />
                And the best way to find out is for you to enter her service and take a poke around on the sly.<br />
                I know you've got what it takes.<br />
                Not only are you a superb fighter, but people want to trust you. I've seen it. </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">Can you become Ranni's vassal to advance our agenda?<br />
                While in her service, you'll be able to take a poke around on the sly.<br />
                And determine the location of her original body that bears the cursemark.<br />
                I realise that I'm asking you to put yourself in grave danger.<br />
                But I know you've got what it takes. Quite possibly the only one, in fact.<br />
                Not only are you a superb fighter, but people want to trust you. I've seen it. </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">D was telling me.<br />
                That he discovered the mark of the centipede.<br />
                The centipede is an ancient symbol of the cursemark.<br />
                As long as whoever finds and uses it is not nefarious by nature,<br />
                then we may be able to form an alliance.<br />
                If only I could speak to them in person.<br />
                And if they were like you, all the better. </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">Hmm. Maybe I should tell you.<br />
                Lately, I feel I'm on the precipice...<br />
                Of falling into a deep...fathomless slumber.<br />
                And I have an inkling it could spell trouble for you, somehow.<br />
                So I just wanted to get the apology out of the way, beforehand.<br />

                This miracle blesses the church to this day.<br />

                He soon repented his territorial aggressions though, and became husband to the Carian Queen.<br />

                Sadly, her heart was broken when Lord Radagon left her.<br />

                After they declared they wouldn't interfere with the Shattering,<br />
                the academy cast repelling seals on the east gate leading to the Capital and the south gate leading here.<br />

            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">Welcome, dear guest.<br />
                After being out there, it must be quite surprising,<br />
                to see our capital, cradled by the Erdtree, showered by an eternal wellspring of grace.<br />
                The sights, the sounds, the luscious scents. Each precisely as they should be. Each eternal. </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">Oh?<br />
                I didn't notice that you were Tarnished.<br />
                ...<br />
                Now, you mustn't take this the wrong way.<br />
                But you must leave the capital at once. </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">It is for your own good, I assure you.<br />
                All things have their proper place.<br />
                We, having been chosen by grace, were given this Golden Capital.<br />
                You, on the other hand, have your own home, which is a far cry from here.<br />
                So far, in fact, that it cannot be further marred by your touch.<br />
                The Shattering caused a great many fools to overstep their bounds.<br />
                Their impudence led to insurgency against Morgott, Lord of Grace. They raised an army, and sought to lay siege to this sacred ground.<br />
                But do you see where it got them? King Morgott's rule would not be shaken!<br />
                Their attempt to defile the capital failed, and while we revelled in eternal grace,<br />
                the traitors were eyed by the grotesque Fell Omen, and their corpses piled high outside the wall!<br />
                The lesson here is self-evident.<br />
                The capital is simply not where you belong. </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">You mustn't take it the wrong way.<br />
                But you must leave the capital at once. </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">Well, what have we here...<br />
                You hunt Omen, do you?<br />
                Mm-hmm, yes it appears so...<br />
                Well, then perhaps we can talk.<br />
                For a barbarous Tarnished, you see the difference between right and wrong rather clearly.<br />
                Very well. I permit your stay in the capital for the time being.<br />
                And in the name of the house of Shanehaight, I beseech you hunt down the foul Omen.<br />
                The Undercapital is a repository of waste.<br />
                For ages it's teemed with repulsive Omen. Fiendlings, even, who've never lost a horn.<br />
                And what's worse, they've taken to bellowing in a most blood-curdling manner. You can hear it all the way up here.<br />
                A vile, ceaseless affront to the Erdtree's sanctity. </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">Get on with it, then.<br />
                Hunt down the vile Omen scurrying about in the Undercapital, and give us peace from those wretched howls.<br />
                I know you can do it. Do not dishonour House Shanehaight. </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">Haven't set off to hunt the Omen yet?<br />
                Well, you're certainly dragging your heels more than I foresaw.<br />
                I forgive you.<br />
                We Shanehaights are known for patience, a virtue amongst the noble. </p>

            <p class="lore">Haven't set off to hunt the Omen yet?<br />

            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">Ohh, there you are, pleased to see you.<br />
                You must've expunged the Omen from the repository.<br />
                Otherwise their revolting screeches would still be affronting my ears.<br />
                Well, you've done us a fine service, I must say.<br />
                The Erdbishops will be very pleased to hear it.<br />
                No, this is above their station...<br />
                If I explained that this was all my idea,<br />
                I could be granted audience with Morgott, Lord of Grace.<br />
                What a wondrous opportunity.<br />
                That a viscount as myself might be seen by the Lord of Grace.<br />
                Such an honour will place me amongst the most venerated Shanehaights. </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">Oh, very sorry, I almost forgot about you completely.<br />
                This Shanehaight heirloom has been held for generations.<br />
                It is yours now, a reward for your fearless execution of my request. </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">I'm afraid its worth might be lost on a Tarnished, but...<br />
                For everything, there is a first. For you, and for House Shanehaight, and its newfound glory. </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">Now, I need to get myself ready.<br />
                If fortune favours me, and I am seen by the Lord of Grace,<br />
                I'd be put to shame if I didn't look my very best. </p>

                Go on, it's yours.<br />
                Now, let me have a look at the needle.<br />
                Hmm.<br />
                Hmmmm.<br />
                Well, well, this is a marvel indeed.<br />
                The work of a true artisan‚Ä¶a meticulous, bold craftsman who grasps the essence of life.<br />
                Can you give me some time with this?<br />
                As well made as it is, it won't be much use snapped in half, will it. </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">I have awaited your return.<br />
                The needle is repaired. Now it will forestall the rotting sickness, I'm sure.<br />
                Will you give it to the girl, Millicent?<br />
                I will reward you in kind.<br />
                Millicent rests at the church atop the cliff, beyond Sellia, the town yonder.<br />
                Tended to by the witless pests who worship her, or rather, her rotting sickness, as a god.<br />
                A wretched fate, indeed. The poor girl, she never wished for any of this. </p>

            <p class="lore">Do you find it peculiar?<br />
                That I would show such concern for the girl.<br />
                Well, I'm the one that found her.<br />
                A mere babe, in the swamp of Aeonia.<br />
                She is one of my dear daughters.<br />
                But the rotting sickness erodes one's memory.<br />
                I doubt that she remembers the first thing about me.<br />
                Oh, I must be getting old. I didn't always worry so much.<br />
                Ha ha ha... </p>

                However, she has no need of me, any more.<br />
                No, she must embark on her journey, and stare her fate in the eye. I mustn't impede.<br />
                As I've aged, I've found the best way to aid the young...<br />

                In truth, before her, I'd never seen a bud of such superior quality.<br />

                of Malenia, goddess of scarlet rot. </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">Queen Marika and her King Consort Radagon were blessed with twin demigods, and Malenia was one of them.<br />
                She was born an Empyrean, carrying the scarlet rot.<br />
                An Empyrean...is no mere demigod.<br />
                In the age of the Elden Ring, and Queen Marika,<br />
                the precious Empyrean was born. A new god to forge a new Order.<br />
                Since Malenia fought Radahn, and the great scarlet flower blossomed in Aeonia, I have dedicated myself to her.<br />
                And to the resplendence of the Order of Rot. The cycle of decay and rebirth. </p>

                Little Millicent, following in the steps of her mother, no matter what.<br />

                My eyes began to well...<br />
                She is to meet them very soon. Her sisters.<br />
                And when she does, she'll be defeated, surely, and begin to flower.<br />
                Which is why...<br />

                It must be done by your hand; no other.<br />
                Millicent trusts you, rather deeply in fact.<br />
                Sever that trust. Nurtured by betrayal, her bud will flower most vividly.<br />
                When Malenia ascends to godhood, Millicent too shall be reborn.<br />

                There is no other way. It must be done by your hand alone.<br />
                You seem to have sown a seed in Millicent's heart.<br />
                Which will flower most vividly, should she be plucked by you.<br />
                Malenia will be a goddess. And once she is, Millicent will flower anew, as a scarlet valkyrie. </p>

            <p class="lore">Oh, was that you? Sorry, I hardly noticed.<br />

            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">The master's reflections had heightened as we neared the Erdtree.<br />
                While still a precise calculus, the rhythms grew increasingly wild.<br />
                Until he simply ceased.<br />
                Now the master is facing quite the puzzle.<br />
                The Golden Order is founded on the principle that Marika is the one true god. However...<br />
                The name of Marika's second husband, King Consort Radagon, also appeared...<br />
                Who exactly was Radagon?<br />
                The master is stumped.<br />
                His finger has remained still, ever since Radagon's name was discovered.<br />
                Curse my mediocre mind.<br />
                The master only has me, and here I fail him... </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">What on earth did you do to the master?<br />
                Well, not that I'm complaining.<br />
                Master's finger moves again, resuming his cogitation; more than good enough for me.<br />
                I haven't the words to thank you.<br />
                So I'd like to pass this on to you instead.<br />
                A glimpse into the heart of the Golden Order, documented by yours truly. </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">To think, that Radagon was Marika herself.<br />
                Or at least, such is all I can interpret from the rhythm and calculus of his finger.<br />
                How would such a thing even have been possible, I wonder.<br />
                Sadly, I cannot comprehend it, myself.<br />
                Do you have a fuller understanding of the matter?<br />
                ...<br />
                Well, either way, I can continue my documentation.<br />
                In truth it matters very little whether I understand the master's thoughts or not,<br />
                I am merely his scribe. It is my sole and unwavering purpose. </p>

                Enchanted by a vain and ruinous delusion, he rejected the perfection of the Golden Order,<br />

                It's only Tarnished like yourself who keep things from drying up entirely.<br />

                A crafting kit allows you to make basic items on your own.<br />
                Essential really, if you intend to survive out here for any duration.<br />
                The kit costs a bundle, and I admit, I do take my cut.<br />
                But the important thing is that you survive. Every customer counts, after all. </p>

                My people, wanderers all, have long been spurned by the grace of gold.<br />
                Which is why we cannot settle, but instead are forced into this pitiful, unceasing journey.<br />
                But thanks to that, things are not so different for us now, though the Elden Ring is shattered.<br />
                I think this makes us kindred spirits of sorts.<br />

                Lament not your solitude. Expect no sympathy. No regard. Nothing.<br />

                That is our code, so to speak.<br />

                I've been searching for it as long as I can remember.<br />

                You'd hope they kept some fine goods there, eh. </p>

                Next time you hear the wolf's howl, make this signal right under the source.<br />
                Oh, don't fret, there is nothing to fear.<br />
                I just have an inkling the two of you might hit it off. </p>

            <p class="lore">My thanks. I've been wanting to get my hands on this.<br />

            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">So, about the letter you brought me...<br />
                It's just as I suspected, it features a cryptogram of my people.<br />
                And I'm sure it's come from wherever the Great Caravan disappeared to.<br />
                This could be my chance to get close to it.<br />
                Thanks to you. </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">Once I decipher that cryptogram, I'll be packing up shop again.<br />
                Don't worry, I'll leave a sign that shows where I've gone.<br />
                With any luck, I'll see you there, eh. </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">I've always preferred my own company, to that of other people's...<br />
                And I don't have any burning questions I wish to ask my ancestors...<br />
                But there's something I need to know.<br />
                My roots.<br />
                I want to know who I am. Where I came from. Where I'm headed. </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">Ah, good to see you.<br />
                I knew leaving the sign would be worth the trouble.<br />
                The shop is all set up.<br />
                A pleasure as ever. Care to purchase anything? </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">Oh yes, about the cryptogram from the letter...<br />
                I think it's pointing underneath the capital.<br />
                I think it's pointing here, underneath the capital.<br />
                But I'm perplexed as to the path to take down there.<br />
                Well, the journey can wait, I suppose.<br />
                I'll settle here for the time being, and start looking into it. </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">Where...did you find this letter? </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">I can't imagine how it ended up there...<br />
                But the well might just lead under the capital.<br />
                To the spot indicated by the cryptogram from the letter.<br />
                Seems like an odd place for the Great Caravan...<br />
                But no amount of thinking will change anything. I'll be heading straight there, after some preparation.<br />
                Once again, I find myself in your debt.<br />
                Take this, as a token of my appreciation.<br />
                It's not from my usual stock, but something rather more special.<br />
                I hope you can join me at the Great Caravan, in fact.<br />
                Who knows what wonders there might be to trade? </p>
            <h4></h4>
            <p class="lore">Ah, you, is it...<br />

                Have you heard their moans? They're hardly human anymore.<br />
                They think we worship the Three Fingers? That we called the maddening sickness down upon them?<br />
                Well. If that's what they expect from us, then that's what they shall get from us! <br />
                The world of grace and its people should have been content to see us sink between the cracks.<br />
                But to have intruded upon our solace... Having broken us upon their whims...<br />
                I'll never forgive any of you. </p>
