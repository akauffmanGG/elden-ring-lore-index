            <div class="description">
                <p>Elden Ring has a rich backstory that is told through snippets of Dialogue and scattered pieces of lore that must be stitched together by the user.</p>
                <p>
                    For this reason, understanding the complete story involves a lot of research and is open to interpretation. This is a compilation of all the lore that exists within the game
                    to make the research easier.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most of this text was mined directly from the game files. This includes some text that didn't make it into the final story which may shed some additional light
                    on the history of the lands between.
